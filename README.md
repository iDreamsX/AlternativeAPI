## For Forge 1.13+ (deleting libraries)

```
Go inside your libraries folder in your host.
Go to libraries/com/google/guava/guava/
And keep only the higher version, delete all others.
## OR
Go inside your delete.cfg folder in your host
and write a new line by putting the location of the guava libraries
which are lower than the highest

Example:
libraries/com/google/guava/guava/15.0/guava-15.0.jar
libraries/com/google/guava/guava/20.0/guava-20.0.jar
libraries/com/google/guava/guava/21.0/guava-21.0.jar

```
